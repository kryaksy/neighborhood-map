# Neighbourhood MAP
A google map app which displays places and markers for locations in Besiktas, the neighbourhood in Istanbul/Turkey. Last project of Udacity FEND Nanodegreeship.
### How to Run:
1. Clone this repo
2. ```cd``` into it
3. ```npm start```
4. Visit localhost:3000
### Tech used:
- React.js ```create-react-app```
- Yarn Package Manager
- Google Maps API
- Foursquare API
- Visual Studio Code
### Important Notes:
- **Offline use** mode works only in production build
Run for production:
1. ```yarn global add serve```
2. ```server -s build```
3. Visit localhost:5000
### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
- `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

- `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### Project Rubric
- Responsiveness
    - All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner.
- Usability
    - All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
- Location Filter
    - Includes a text input field or dropdown menu that filters the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input or selection. Filter function runs error-free.
- List View
    - A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a filter is applied.
    - Clicking a location on the list displays unique information about the location, and animates its associated map marker (e.g. bouncing, color change.)
    - List functionality is responsive and runs error free.
- Map and Markers
    - Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.
    - Clicking a marker displays unique information about a location somewhere on the page (modal, separate div, inside an infoWindow).
    - Any additional custom functionality provided in the app functions error-free.
- Asynchronous API Requests
    - Application utilizes the Google Maps API or another mapping system and at least one non-Google third-party API. Refer to this documentation
    - All data requests are retrieved in an asynchronous manner using either the Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest.
- Error Handling
    - Data requests that fail are handled gracefully using common fallback techniques (i.e. AJAX error or fail methods). 'Gracefully' means the user isn’t left wondering why a component isn’t working. If an API doesn’t load there should be some visible indication on the page that it didn’t load.
- README
    - A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.
- Comments
    - Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.
- Additional Location Data
    - Functionality providing additional data about a location is provided and sourced from a 3rd party API. Information can be provided either in the marker’s infoWindow, or in an HTML element in the DOM (a sidebar, the list view, a modal, etc.)
    - Provide attribution for the source of additional data. For example, if using Foursquare, indicate somewhere in your UI and in your README that you are using Foursquare data.
- Error Free
    - Application runs without console errors.
- Usability
    - Functionality is presented in a usable and responsive manner.
- Focus
    - Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.
- Site elements are defined semantically
    - Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.
- Accessible Images
    - All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.
- Service Worker
    - When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
- Proper Use of React
    - React code follows a reasonable component structure.
    - State control is managed appropriately: event handlers are passed as props to child components, and state is managed by parent component functions when appropriate.
    - There are at least 5 locations in the model. These may be hard-coded or retrieved from a data API.
    - There are no errors. There are no warnings that resulted from not following the best practices listed in the documentation, such as using key for list items. All code is functional and formatted properly.
